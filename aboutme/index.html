    <p>Hello everyone! I am 29 years old from Bayombong Nueva Vizcaya Philippines. I am married and a mom of theree beautiful kids.I love cooking and making DIYs during my free time and It's also my way of releasing stress.</p>
    <p> I just got finished pathway and I am now planning to have a degree in Software Development. My interest to learn programming started because of my husband, he's a software engineer. I became curious about his job and projects that he's doing. I know Iam starting from scrath but I do believe that there's a help ahead when we do our part. Before pursuing this course I am into business and experinced becoming a General Virtual Assistant as part time then I stopped and enrolled in BYU-Pathway to pursue a degree.</p>
    <p>I am a child of record and I will be forever grateful that I became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Also I am so grateful how the pathway and BYU-Idaho program will possibly help me to pursue my eduation through online because it is more convenient for me since I am also a full-time mom.</p>
    <p>I am so excited and looking forward in this course as well as to get to know you all!</p>
